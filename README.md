FaceMesh:- 
Face Mesh is a face geometry solution that estimates 468 3D face landmarks in real-time. It can be used as facial landmarks for detecting eyes, mouth, jawline, nose & eyebrows. Face mesh is mainly useful for real-time augmented reality (AR) applications.
Generate face mesh dataset using Google's FaceMesh model from annotated face datasets.


Features:-
There are built in features to help generating the dataset more efficiently.

Automatically centralize the marked face.
Rotate the image to align the face horizontally.
Crop the face with custom scale range.
Generate mark heatmaps.
Write TensorFlow Record files, or export the processed image and marks.
